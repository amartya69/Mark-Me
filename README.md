# Mark-Me

Getting Started
Installation
Install the dependencies:

npm install
Development
Start the development server with HMR:

npm run dev
Your application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

Building for Production
Create a production build:

npm run build
Deployment
Docker Deployment
To build and run using Docker:

docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

AWS ECS
Google Cloud Run
Azure Container Apps
Digital Ocean App Platform
Fly.io
Railway
DIY Deployment
If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of npm run build

├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets

Styling
This template comes with Tailwind CSS already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.





Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:


npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
